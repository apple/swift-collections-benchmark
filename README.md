# Swift Collections Benchmark

This package lets you collect and easily visualize performance data about data structure implementations and collection algorithms. It was created to help develop the [Swift Collections] package, but it's useful for so much more!

[Swift Collections]: https://github.com/apple/swift-collections

This project primarily concentrates on benchmarking Swift code, but it can also be used to run benchmarks (and, especially, to analyze benchmark results) in other languages, too.

## Example

Here is a short benchmark, measuring the performance of `Array.sorted()` and `Set.contains(_:)`:

``` swift
import CollectionsBenchmark

var benchmark = Benchmark(title: "Demo Benchmark")

benchmark.addSimple(
  title: "Array<Int> sorted",
  input: [Int].self
) { input in
  blackHole(input.sorted())
}

benchmark.add(
  title: "Set<Int> contains",
  input: ([Int], [Int]).self
) { input, lookups in
  let set = Set(input)
  return { timer in
    for value in lookups {
      precondition(set.contains(value))
    }
  }
}

benchmark.main()
```

Here is how you run it:

``` shellsession
$ swift run -c release benchmark run results --cycles 5
Running 2 tasks on 76 sizes from 1 to 1M:
  Array<Int> sorted
  Set<Int> contains
Output file: /Users/klorentey/Projects/swift-collections-benchmark-demo/Demo/results
Appending to existing data (if any) for these tasks/sizes.

Finished in 26.6s
$ swift run -c release benchmark render results chart.png
$ open chart.png
```

And this is what you get:

Today I learned that sorting 20 integers in an `Array` takes about as much time as looking at all items in a 20-member `Set`. Fascinating! ðŸ¤“

## Project Status

Swift Collections Benchmark is intended primarily as a developer tool, rather than something that would be used in production apps.

It exposes a source-level API and a command line interface, neither of which are technically stable yet. After an initial period of experimentation, we expect to stabilize both interfaces. Until then, new releases may sometimes come with changes that might break existing benchmark definitions, or that may change the command line interface in ways that could break existing scripts. We'll try our best to keep this to a minimum, though (or mitigate with a multi-release deprecation period), even during this chaotic initial period.

## Adding Swift Collections Benchmark as a Dependency

To use this package in a SwiftPM project, add the following line to the dependencies in your `Package.swift` file:

```swift
.package(url: "https://github.com/apple/swift-collections-benchmark", from: "0.0.1"),
```

In the typical case, you'll want to set up a standalone executable target that is dedicated to benchmarking:

```swift
// swift-tools-version:5.3
import PackageDescription

let package = Package(
  name: "MyPackage",
  products: [
    .executable(name: "my-benchmark", targets: ["MyBenchmark"]),
  ],
  dependencies: [
    .package(url: "https://github.com/apple/swift-collections-benchmark", from: "0.0.1"),
    // ... other dependencies ...
  ],
  targets: [
    // ... other targets ...
    .target(
      name: "MyBenchmark",
      dependencies: [
        .product(name: "CollectionsBenchmark", package: "swift-collections-benchmark"),
      ]),
  ]
)
```

2. Submit a PR with your implementation, and participate in the review discussion. Sometimes we may need to go through several revisions! This is fine -- it makes the end result that much better.
3. When there is a consensus that the feature is desirable, and the implementation works well, it will be merged. 
4. Celebrate!
