This package lets you collect and easily visualize performance data about data structure implementations and collection algorithms. It was created to help develop the [Swift Collections] package, but it's useful for so much more!

[Swift Collections]: https://github.com/apple/swift-collections

This project primarily concentrates on benchmarking Swift code, but it can also be used to run benchmarks (and, especially, to analyze benchmark results) in other languages, too.

## Example

Here is a short benchmark, measuring the performance of `Array.sorted()` and `Set.contains(_:)`:

``` swift
import CollectionsBenchmark

var benchmark = Benchmark(title: "Demo Benchmark")

benchmark.addSimple(
  title: "Array<Int> sorted",
  input: [Int].self
) { input in
  blackHole(input.sorted())
}

benchmark.add(
  title: "Set<Int> contains",
  input: ([Int], [Int]).self
) { input, lookups in
  let set = Set(input)
  return { timer in
    for value in lookups {
      precondition(set.contains(value))
    }
  }
}

benchmark.main()
```

Here is how you run it:

``` shellsession
$ swift run -c release benchmark run results --cycles 5
Running 2 tasks on 76 sizes from 1 to 1M:
  Array<Int> sorted
  Set<Int> contains
Output file: /Users/klorentey/Projects/swift-collections-benchmark-demo/Demo/results
Appending to existing data (if any) for these tasks/sizes.

Finished in 26.6s
$ swift run -c release benchmark render results chart.png
$ open chart.png
```

And this is what you get:

Today I learned that sorting 20 integers in an `Array` takes about as much time as looking at all items in a 20-member `Set`. Fascinating! ðŸ¤“

## Project status

This package is intended primarily to be a developer tool, rather than something that would be used in production apps.

This package is not source stable; its API surface, its command line interface, and the format/contents of the files it generates is subject to change between tags, sometimes in ways that breaks clients that were written for previous releases.

## Adding this package as a dependency

To use this package in a SwiftPM project, add the following line to the dependencies in your `Package.swift` file:

```swift
.package(url: "https://github.com/apple/swift-collections-benchmark", from: "0.0.4"),
```

In the typical case, you'll want to set up a standalone executable target that is dedicated to benchmarking:

```swift
// swift-tools-version:6.1
import PackageDescription

let package = Package(
  name: "MyPackage",
  products: [
    .executable(name: "my-benchmark", targets: ["MyBenchmark"]),
  ],
  dependencies: [
    .package(url: "https://github.com/apple/swift-collections-benchmark", from: "0.0.1"),
    // ... other dependencies ...
  ],
  targets: [
    // ... other targets ...
    .target(
      name: "MyBenchmark",
      dependencies: [
        .product(name: "CollectionsBenchmark", package: "swift-collections-benchmark"),
      ]),
  ]
)
```
